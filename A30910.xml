            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:103263:3"/> own and others; and by God's Word, to work <hi>Faith,</hi> rather than feed <hi>Fancy:</hi> Charity, I ſay, thou muſt have, for that will <hi>cover a multitude of Sins,</hi> much more of Infirmities, which here thou muſt expect to meet: <hi>Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth all things, endureth all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. If thou wilt but exerciſe thy Charity in reading, and join there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thy fervent Prayers for a Bleſſing, thou mayeſt attain thine End and mine alſo, to wit, thy <hi>Edification;</hi> for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity edifieth.</p>
            <p>In hope of gaining thy Charity, ſuffer me to give a ſhort (but true) Account of the enſuing Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> I being about three Years ſince, for ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, retired from my Family and place of Abode; and by Sickneſs, and other things, confined; during which time, many of my dear Friends and Relations in Chriſt were called home to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Houſe; whereupon I thought it my Duty to write ſome Lines to their
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:103263:3"/> ſurviving Relations, as I was by them deſired to do; and after ſeeking God for Counſel and Aſſiſtance, I thought on this Text ſpoken to in the following Diſcourſe; (for it was not at the leaſt in my Thoughts ever to publiſh this, or any other, knowing my own inability) I wrote in my homely Stile what thou wilt here find (all except the Title-Page, This, and the Poſt-ſcript) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating it to the Capacities of the plaineſt Chriſtians; to whom I then ſent it, and with whom it lodg'd; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til about ſix months ſince it pleaſed the only Wiſe God to bring me to a trial of my Faith and Patience; ſo deep a ſtroke it was, that I uſed all means for my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and it came into my Mind, that ſuch a thing I had written ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to help in ſuch Caſes, and that ſeveral had found benefit by it, I made enquiry after it, and at laſt found it; and in reading of it, <hi>as the Word of God,</hi> and begging God's Bleſſing on it, I found much Relief and Comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:103263:4"/> (all Praiſe and Thanks to God) and thereupon had ſome ſmall Inclinations to communicate the ſame to others; and after many ſtruglings and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in my ſelf, and with Prayers and Tears I beſought the Lord to direct me: At laſt I conſidered, I muſt ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put off this my earthly Tabernacle, and having for many Years been lain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide like a broken Veſſel of no uſe, and compaſſed with many bodily Infirmities, I was willing to leave behind me a little ſcrap of my Labours to my Children and Friends, to put them in mind of what I had taught them for above thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years together, that they might be fortified againſt all the Troubles of this Life, and by <hi>Faith</hi> in God and Chriſt, hold faſt and not loſe their Crown.</p>
            <p>But why ſo mean a thing as this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the learned Labours of ſo many eminent Writers on the like Subject?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, That our Lord took ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al notice of the Widows Mites; and he will <hi>not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things,</hi> Zech. 4. 10.</p>

Such as will not make uſe of it, let them do better, and I will be glad.</p>
            <p>None may be afraid to buy or read it, for there is not a word of the <hi>State,</hi> or <hi>Church-Matters in it;</hi> I daily pray for the Proſperity of both, but think it not my Duty to meddle with either, but in ſubjection.</p>
            <p>Two Requeſts I have to thee, loving Reader:</p>
            <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:103263:5"/>
            <p n="1"> 1. Pray for a Bleſſing upon as much as you find to be the expreſs Will of God.</p>

Pray for me, that I may more and more find and feel the Life and Power of thoſe, and all the Truths of God in mine own Heart, and may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs more of the Life of Faith in my whole Converſation, and I will alſo pray for thee, that thou mayeſt find as much (and much more) benefit in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, as I have in compoſing and peruſing it; all praiſe to the God of all Grace. If you find ſome Paſſages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (in your Opinion) too often repeated, be not offended, till you find them too powerful on your Hearts.</p>
            <p>Thus committing this poor Eſſay to the Bleſſing of him who is the Father of Mercies, and can <hi>teach us to profit,</hi> by his Word and Rod, and thy ſelf to his Love and Favour in Jeſus Chriſt; in him I remain for thy Soul's good,</p>

Yet we are not forbidden to be troubled for <hi>Zion.</hi> It is a grievous Sin, not to be <hi>grieved for the Afflictions of</hi> Joſeph: Surely, we muſt be troubled for God's Diſhonour, <hi>becauſe Men break God's Commandments.</hi> Trouble of Heart, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Sin, is ſinful Trouble. Where Sin lies heavy, Affliction lies light. Iſa. 33. 24. <hi>They ſhall not ſay, I am ſick; for their Iniquities ſhall be forgiven them.</hi> Senſe of Pardon to thoſe Souls that have felt the burden of Sin, much alleviates and lightens the burden of Affliction,

            <p>We are always too prone to fall into Extreams, to ſin either in Exceſs or in Defect; too much, or too little; we are faulty both ways. As for Sin, which is the worſt of Evils, we are apt to be troubled too little. How few fail here in the Exceſs, tho 'tis poſſible ſo to do; and ſome have, that refuſe to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all the ſweet Promiſes of Chriſt in the Goſpel: But there are but few of thoſe; moſt of us fail in the Defect. We are not troubled for Sin ſo much as we ſhould; our Sins do not lie ſo hard and heavy upon as they ſhould; our Hearts do ſeldom feel the weight of Sin preſſing us down: many Sins lie light on us; our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But our Afflictions, which, compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, are but light, lie too heavy upon us, and preſs us down even to the Duſt. So, in reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ct of Afflictions themſelves, we are apt to ran into Extreams, againſt which the Holy Ghoſt gives caution as to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103263:9"/> both Extreams. Prov. 3. 11, 12. <hi>My Son, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtning of the Lord; neither be weary of his Chaſtiſements;</hi> the Apoſtle explains it, <hi>neither faint when thou art corrected of him,</hi> Heb. 12. 5, 6.

Alſo, you muſt not be weary of them, nor faint under them, for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they ſhall not hurt you, they flow from your Father's Love, from <hi>a Father</hi> they come, who delighteth in you, and therefore ye ought not to faint under them; or, as it is in the Text, Whatever Affliction befals you, <hi>let not your Heart be troubled.</hi>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God's choiceſt Saints, are in this World ſubject to all kinds of Troubles, Loſſes, and Afflictions; and whence it is, and why ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That under thoſe Loſſes and Afflictions, they are ſubject to Deſpond, to be Dejected, and to be Troubled in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What this <hi>Heart-Trouble</hi> is, that Chriſt forbids here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> How, that Believing in God and Chriſt, is the beſt means to prevent, and cure this <hi>Heart-Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, That God's choiceſt Saints are liable to all kinds of Troubles, Loſſes, and Afflictions; even the greateſt, heavieſt, and ſoreſt: as we read of <hi>Job, David, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>God had but one <hi>Son</hi> without Sin, but no <hi>Son</hi> without Suffering. His only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son was a Man of Sorrows; and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> aſſures us, that <hi>if ye be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out chaſtning, whereof all are partakers, then are ye Baſtards and not Sons,</hi> Heb. 8. 12.</p>
            <p>God's Children are liable to Sufferings, whether we conſider them as <hi>Men,</hi> or as <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> as <hi>Men,</hi> Job 14. 1. <hi>Man that is born of a Woman, is full of Trouble.</hi> As
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103263:16"/> our Relations and Comforts increaſe, ſo do the Occaſions of Trouble. God never appointed this World to be the place of Man's <hi>Reſt,</hi> but of our Exerciſe, and only a <hi>Paſſage</hi> to another World: And in this our Paſſage we muſt look for Storms and Tempeſts: If we can through Mercy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a tolerable <hi>Paſſage</hi> thorow this World, and a comfortable <hi>Paſſage</hi> out of it into that <hi>better</hi> above, we ſhall have cauſe to bleſs the Lord to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>And much more, as Chriſtians, muſt we expect Troubles: for a Man is no ſooner brought home to God, but he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be hated by the World, aſſaulte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> all Chriſtians prepare for Affliction, by getting an Intereſt in God through Chriſt by getting Sin pardoned and purged, by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103263:16"/> getting Peace with God and Conſcience, by getting Hearts crucified to the World; and then, when Troubles come, let us bear them as Chriſtians, not murmur, not repine, but in patience poſſeſs our Souls: not deſponding nor fainting; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that our Troubles are no more, but infinitely leſs than we have deſerved. Job 34. 23. He <hi>will not lay upon Man more than right.</hi> God perfectly underſtands our <hi>Need,</hi> and knows our <hi>Strength:</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6. <hi>If need be, ye are in heavineſs. He is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13. It is the Wiſe, Juſt, and Gracious God, and our Father that tempers our Cup for us. Many Earthly Parents do not correct their Children in <hi>meaſure,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of their Nature and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and therefore their Correction doth them no good. Many Phyſicians miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Conſtitutions of their Patients, and therefore may do them more hurt than good: But God knows our Need, and our Strength, and ſo ſutes all his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies</hi> accordingly; therefore let us be patient, bearing our Troubles with an equal Mind, not ſuffering as <hi>per-force,</hi> but willingly. It is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>That</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103263:17"/> 
               <hi>they yielded their Bodies,</hi> that is, chearfully, <hi>to the Fire.</hi> In our Affliction, let us ſearch our Hearts, and try our Ways; let us fly to God by Prayer, and reſign up our ſelves to him, and truſt in him, caſting our Cares and Burdens on him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 22. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is our Wiſdom, that while we are at eaſe, have our Comforts about us, let us look for Troubles; Afflictions <hi>from</hi> God, as well as <hi>for</hi> God, are part of our Croſs which we muſt take up daily. Sickneſs, death of Friends, loſs of Eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we muſt look for them, that we may not be ſurprized.</p>
            <p>He that buildeth an Houſe, or a Ship doth not make this his Work and Care, that it ſhould not rain upon it; or that it ſhould have no Storms or Tempeſts, for this cannot be prevented by any care of ours, but that the Houſe or Ship may be made able to endure all without prejudice. So, muſt it be our care, to provide for <hi>Afflictions;</hi> for to prevent them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we cannot; but prepare for them we may, and muſt, as was hinted before; to treaſure up God's Promiſes, and ſtore our Souls with Graces, and ſpiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and firm Reſolutions in God's
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103263:17"/> ſtrength, to bear up and hold on: We had need be well <hi>ſhod with the preparation of the Goſpel of Peace,</hi> Eph. 6. 15.</p>
            <p>Moſt Chriſtians are not mortified and crucified to the World, not acquainted with God and the Promiſes, as they ought to be, nor ſo reſolved to follow God ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they ought, and therefore are ſo dejected and diſcontented when Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes. O that we did count the <hi>Coſt,</hi> when we firſt begin to make Profeſſion of Chriſt; and that we had had ſuch full <hi>Perſwaſions</hi> of the incomparable <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Excellencies</hi> of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> as that we could willingly part with all things for his ſake! O that we had ſuch believing Apprehenſions of the Wiſdom, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Righteouſneſs and Mercy of God, ſuch ſights of his reconciled Face, and ſuch taſtes of his fatherly Love to us in Chriſt, as that we could quietly ſubmit to his holy Will, and be well ſatisfied with all his Diſpenſations towards us. So much of this firſt Particular.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Diſciples of Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Afflictions which they meet with in this World, are apt to be troubled in their Hearts, to be diſquieted in their Minds, to be dejected and diſcouraged.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103263:18"/> It was ſo with holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 42. 5. <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? why art thou diſquieted within me?</hi> He was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his Afflictions, and that diſquieted him, and caſt him down. God's People are ſubject to ſuch diſquietments, becauſe they are Fleſh and Blood, ſubject to the ſame Paſſions, made of the ſame Mould, ſubject to the ſame Impreſſions from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out as other Men, and their Natures are upheld with the ſame Supports and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments as others, the withdrawing and want of which affecteth them as well as others. And beſides thoſe Troubles they ſuffer in common with others, by reaſon of their being <hi>called</hi> out of the World, the World <hi>hates</hi> them, and they are therefore more expoſed to Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation than others, and ſo are apt to be caſt down and diſcouraged: This our Lord foreſaw would befal his Diſciples after his departure from them; and therefore he counſels them againſt the ſame: <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But it may be demanded, <hi>Whence ariſeth this Heart-trouble, and diſquietment of Mind under Affliction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are many Cauſes of it, which is neceſſary for us to know, that ſo,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103263:18"/> knowing the Cauſes, we may the better find the Cure. There are outward and inward Cauſes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Outward</hi> Cauſes. And the firſt may be <hi>God</hi> himſelf. He ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws the Beams of his Countenance, withholds the ſenſe of his Love, hideth his Face from his Children: (which the Saints in Scripture ſo bitterly complain of, and ſo earneſtly pray againſt). Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Souls, even of the ſtrongeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are diſquieted. This cauſed trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Soul of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 37. When a poor Child of God, together with his Affliction, apprehends God to be his Enemy, and that his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are mix'd with God's Diſpleaſure; and it may be his Conſcience tells him, that God hath a juſt Quarrel againſt him, becauſe he hath not walked ſo holily, ſo humbly, ſo evenly and ſo ſtrictly with God as he might, had he been more watchful, careful, and circumſpect; and that he hath not renewed and kept his Peace with God as he ſhould, and might have done; and this ſenſe of God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, puts a Sting into all his Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this cauſeth trouble of Heart, and diſquietment of Mind. And juſtly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103263:19"/> may ſuch a Soul be troubled that has ever felt the <hi>Joys of God's Salvation,</hi> the ſweet Influences of his Love, that has <hi>taſted that the Lord is gracious, ſeeing, that in his Favour is Life, and his Loving-kindneſs is better than Life;</hi> Pſal. 30. 5. &amp; 63. 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Devil is the Cauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of the Heart-trouble of God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For he being a curſed Spirit, caſt out of Heaven, full of Diſquietment and Diſcontent himſelf, labours all he can to trouble and diſquiet others, to bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as much as in him lies) into the ſame curſed Condition with himſelf: He being caſt out of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> himſelf, envie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of a good and quiet <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> for that is our Paradiſe until we come to Heaven: And this Paradiſe a poor Child of God may poſſeſs in a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> in a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> on a <hi>Dunghil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two main Deſigns the Devil hath upon Men; the one is, if poſſibly, by all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Slights, Temptations, and Intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he may keep Men in a courſe of Ungodlineſs, to hinder them from coming to Chriſt by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> to deter them from his holy Ways. And when he cannot proſper in this, but that unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rich and free Grace takes hold of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103263:19"/> ſome poor Souls, and they are ſnatch'd out of his Hands, their Captivity led captive by that <hi>mighty Redeemer;</hi> then all the Devil's labour is, to hinder their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and to interrupt their Peace, and to make their way to Heaven as hard and uncomfortable to them as poſſible, purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with all dejecting and Heart-troubling Temptations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Wicked Men are alſo <hi>active</hi> in the troubling of God's People; they are indeed the true Troublers of God's <hi>Iſrael.</hi> They load God's People with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: And there is nothing that the Nature of Man is more impatient of, than Reproaches, for there is no Man ſo mean, but thinks himſelf worthy of ſome Reſpect; now a reproachful Scorn ſhews an utter diſreſpect of a Man, which flows from the very ſuperfluity of Malice. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach hath broken my Heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 69. 20. and nothing more doth he complain of than Reproach, and nothing more are God's People liable to than this. Theſe are the Cauſes from without.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are Inward Cauſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of Heart-trouble and Deſpondency: When God's People are in Affliction, moſt time that black Cloud of <hi>Melancholy</hi> alſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103263:20"/> ſurrounds them, and Darkneſs makes Men fearful and dejected.</p>
            <p>There are many Cauſes within our ſelves. As <hi>ignorance</hi> of God, and of Chriſt, of the Govenant of Grace, of the Name of God. They that know God's Name, will truſt in him, and not be dejected. Alſo, forgetfulneſs of God, and of what he hath done for us. We forget God, when we are afraid of Man. Our <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking,</hi> and paſſing by the many Comforts we enjoy, even while we are under Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, taking little notice of our <hi>Mercies,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut let them be all ſwallowed up in our <hi>Miſeries;</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he had no Heir: and <hi>Rachel,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Give me Children, or I die;</hi> though ſhe had all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earthly Comforts, yet the want of this <hi>one</hi> ſo troubled her, that all the <hi>reſt</hi> ſeemed nothing.</p>
            <p>It is an evil thing for us to be wedded to our own Wills. None more ſubject to Diſcontent, than thoſe who would have all things after their own way, and are meer Strangers to Self-denial. Likewiſe, <hi>falſe apprehenſions</hi> of things cauſe Heart-trouble; to think God hates us, becauſe he corrects us; and when he takes from us, that it is all in Wrath. Another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103263:20"/> Cauſe, is our own <hi>Watchleſſneſs</hi> and Careleſſneſs, our neglect of keeping our Hearts and Conſciences pure and clean; and in time of Affliction, theſe former neglects of Duty come to our Minds, then Conſcience awakes, and tells us our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Faults, and this brings trouble of Heart. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 18.</p>
            <p>Moreover, unneceſſary <hi>Scruples</hi> cauſe Diſquietneſs, Solitarineſs, Idleneſs; when Perſons will not do what is needful, they are troubled with that which is needleſs; and Idleneſs tempts the Devil to tempt us and trouble us: If we cannot find work for our ſelves, the Devil will make work for us.</p>
            <p>Alſo when we are guilty of <hi>neglecting doing good</hi> to others, as to our <hi>Relations,</hi> not reproving, admoniſhing, or incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them as we ought, or have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive that good from them that we might, but now they are dead and gone, and we can no more do any good to them, nor receive any from them; this hath troubled many on their Sick and Death-beds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> wavering in the Ways of God, will alſo breed diſquiet. And our <hi>inordinate love</hi> of Creature-Comforts, our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103263:21"/> ſetting of our Hearts on Friends, Eſtates, and the like, letting out our Hearts on Husbands, Wives, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is to build Caſtles in the Air, expecting Contentment in and from thoſe things that cannot yield it. Alſo <hi>multitude of worldly Buſineſs,</hi> and too much <hi>poring</hi> on our Afflictions, and <hi>fore-caſting</hi> the <hi>Events</hi> of things. You ſee what a croud of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes here be within our ſelves of Diſquiet and Heart-trouble.</p>
            <p>The third Particular propoſed is, What is this <hi>Heart-trouble</hi> which Chriſt here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids his People, and that he would fortify them againſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> This <hi>Heart-trouble</hi> is ſuch a ſenſe of Evils felt or feared, as creates to us Heart-diſquietment, Dejection, Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, depriving us of that Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Peace and Comfort which we had in our ſelves, or otherwiſe might have: It is ſuch a diſturbance of our Paſſions, ſuch a ſtorm and tempeſt in our Spirits, as cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth inward Motions, Emotions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of Mind, putting all things in the Soul out of order: and it carries in it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Evil Things, as follow.</p>
            <pb n="35" facs="tcp:103263:21"/>
            <p>Firſt, Sinful <hi>Sorrow,</hi> worldly Sorrow. When Chriſt had told his Diſciples that he would leave them; and that after he was gone, they ſhould be expoſed to hard and heavy things from the World, bitter Perſecution for his Name-ſake; then ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row filled their Hearts, <hi>John</hi> 16. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p>God's own Servants, Chriſt's own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples may have their Hearts filled with Sorrow; againſt this, our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands many Preſervatives in this <hi>Sermon.</hi> The ground of this Sorow is from our ſelves, from our own Hearts, though Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will have a hand in it; and it comes not from <hi>Humility,</hi> but from <hi>Pride;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot have our Wills, therefore we are diſcontented. We may thank our ſelves, not only for our Troubles, but for our over-much troubling of our ſelves in our Troubles. If we ward and guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this worldly Sorrow, our Troubles would not lie ſo heavy on us as they do: for, as the Joy of the Lord doth raiſe and ſtrengthen the Soul, ſo doth Sorrow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and weaken it: Sorrow and Grief doth lie like Lead to the Heart, cold and heavy, and ſinks it downward ſtill: Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row contracteth and draweth the Soul
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103263:22"/> into it ſelf, from that Communion and Comfort it might have with God and Man; and it weakneth the execution of the Offices of it, becauſe it drinketh up the Spirits, it melteth the Soul, it cauſeth it to drop away. Yea, in this kind of Heart-trouble, God's own People are many times more exceſſive than others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, many times their Burdens are greater, their Temptations, Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Trouble for Sin greater: As their Joys are unſpeakable and glorious, ſo their Sorrows are ſometimes above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Common natural Courage will carry a Man thorow other ſingle Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But <hi>Sin</hi> is a heavier burden than <hi>Affliction,</hi> and the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God than the <hi>Wrath</hi> of Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have a greater ſenſe than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their Hearts being made tender by <hi>Religion,</hi> they have alſo a clearer Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than others, and ſee more into the nature of things than others; they ſee a greater Evil in <hi>Sin,</hi> and in the <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God, than others: They value God's Favour more than others, therefore when he hides his Face, they cannot but be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. They obſerve more of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God in afflictive Providences
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103263:22"/> than others do, and therefore they have more Sorrow.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They have more tender Affections than others; the <hi>new</hi> Heart is a ſoft Heart. A Stamp is ſooner ſet upon <hi>Wax</hi> than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Stone.</hi> A wicked Man hath more cauſe to be troubled than a godly Man; but he is not a Man of that tenderneſs and ſenſe, and therefore is not ſo affected, either with God's dealings with <hi>him,</hi> or with his dealings with God.</p>
            <p>Thus we find often in Scripture good Souls depreſſed with Sorrow. <hi>David</hi> ſaid, he was <hi>like a Skin-bottle in the Smoak</hi> all wrinkled and dried up. Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 11. <hi>When thou with Rebukes doſt correct Man for Sin,</hi> (that is, by Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, death of Relations, and other Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) <hi>thou makeſt his Beauty</hi> (that is, of his outward Man) <hi>to conſume away like a Moth.</hi> Whereas the Beauty of the <hi>Soul</hi> grows fair by Affliction, but that of the <hi>Body</hi> is blaſted. Age, Sickneſs, Loſſes, will make the Beauty of the <hi>Body</hi> to <hi>fade,</hi> but of the <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>ſhine.</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 14. <hi>Though our outward Man doth decay and periſh, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man is renewed day by day.</hi> But for worldly Sorrow; that, too often, not only weakneth the Body, but alſo cauſeth

               <hi>7ly.</hi> This worldly Sorrow indiſpoſeth to all good Duties; it makes a Man like an Inſtrument out of Tune, or a Bone out of Joint; which makes the Body move both uncomely and painfully: it unfits for Duty to God and Man.</p>

None hold their Heads ſo high now, but they muſt ſhortly lay them down in the Duſt. We, and our deareſt Relations muſt part.</p>
            <p>It would be our wiſdom, to turn the ſtream of our Sorrow for Loſſes and Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, into godly Sorrow for Sin, then it will run in its right Channel. Let our <hi>Sins</hi> lie heavy upon us, and then our <hi>Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> will lie light: Let us grow weary of our Sins, not of our Sufferings. <hi>God doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men, Lam.</hi> 3. 33.

            <p>But that which ſhould moſtly affect us, and make us take heed of immoderate worldly Sorrow, is, to conſider, that this kind of Sorrow of Heart, is God's Curſe, imprecated on God's Enemies; <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 65. <hi>Give them Sorrow of Heart, thy Curſe.</hi> As godly Sorrow is God's <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> a Grace of God's Spirit, a Fruit of the Covenant of Grace, and a Fruit of Faith, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> They that ſorrow for <hi>Sin</hi> ſhall be comforted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 4. but, they that mourn immoderately for outward Loſſes, there ſhall be none to comfort them. This is the firſt piece of Heart-Trouble which Jeſus Chriſt hath forbidden, <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled,</hi> that is, not filled, and overcome with worldly Sorrow: what ever your Loſſes and Croſſes be, let not your Sorrow go beyond its lawful bounds; take heed, <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another piece of <hi>Heart-Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> is Sinful <hi>Fear.</hi> And againſt this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper alſo Chriſt counſelleth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Let not your Heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 27.

            <p>This <hi>Fear</hi> is a Paſſion, or rather a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of Mind, whereby, upon the ſenſe of approaching Evils, the Mind is diſcompos'd and diſorder'd, and the Heart troubled and dejected.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Fear</hi> is a <hi>Tyrant</hi> where it comes, and it tyrannizeth where it prevails, as <hi>Job</hi> 4. 14, 15.

            <p n="1">1.

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a lawful filial Fear of God's Judgments, which ariſeth from the conſideration of the Evil of Sin, and of God's Righteouſneſs, of his hatred of Sin, and his wrath againſt it; which Fear produceth, <hi>Repentance, Self-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a turning to God</hi> with our whole Hearts, thorow Reformation, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure our ſelves in God's Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to hide our Selves.

Nevertheleſs we muſt take heed that we be not offended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly; Temptations</hi> from Satan may cauſe Heart-trouble and Vexation: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's Suggeſtions, his fiery Darts, theſe tormenting Thoughts which he caſts into the Minds of Chriſt's Diſciples, create to them much Diſturbance and Heart-trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. So ſoon as any Man is pluck'd out of the Devil's Hands, by the mighty Power of Chriſt's Spirit, he falls upon him ſpeedily with all his force, to trouble ſuch a Soul and vex it; ſo that he ſhall enjoy little peace if Satan can hinder it. So long as the Devil keeps <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> in the Soul, he keeps all in peace, (a ſad Peace!) But when a <hi>ſtronger</hi> than he comes, and caſteth out this ſtrong Man armed, then Satan rageth, to recover his loſt Captive Soul, and vexeth that Soul with all his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. But let not this break your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103263:31"/> Peace, nor cauſe Heart-trouble. As Chriſt hath overcome the World, and therefore bids his Diſciples to be of good chear, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20. So hath he alſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Devil, he hath trodden this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> under his Feet already, and this <hi>Prince</hi> of Peace will tread him under your feet alſo ſhortly: Therefore, <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly; Deſertion,</hi> another (and not the leaſt) piece of Heart-trouble; this may be the caſe of Chriſt's Diſciples. We read of the Saints complaining that God had <hi>forſaken</hi> them; and when he hideth his Face, they cannot but be troubled.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God doth but ſeem to hide his Face, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 14, 15. When God takes away their earthly Comforts from them, and ſuffereth ſharp and bitter Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to befal them; and though they cry unto him, he doth not remove them, then they think that God hath forſaken them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God doth really forſake his People, as to the ſenſe of his Favour: Iſa. 54. 7, 8. <hi>For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee. In a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee for a moment.</hi> And this is, either by <hi>withholding</hi> comfort from them
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103263:31"/> which they cry for; or by <hi>withdrawing</hi> that Comfort from them which they had; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 11. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. 1, 2, 3, 23. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Yet here God ſupported and ſuſtained his Servant's Soul with Grace many times. When God's People have <hi>leaſt Comfort,</hi> they have <hi>moſt Grace,</hi> moſt Humility, Patience, Self-denial, thirſtings after God, Heavenly-mindedneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God's People may loſe the ſenſe of his Love, but never loſe his Love, for that is everlaſting. But to loſe the ſenſe of his Love, is a grievous trouble to a gracious Soul, that hath taſted and felt the Love of God and his Favour; for their great Happineſs is to have the Favour of God; <hi>In his Favour is Life,</hi> and <hi>his Loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is better than Life.</hi> This is the Joy of their Lives <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 119. 135.) which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſo earneſtly prayed for. Now ſuch as have found this, muſt needs be troubled when they loſe it.</p>
            <p>Two things chiefly cauſe God to hide his Face from his People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When their Hearts are too much ſet upon, and carried out after earthly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 6, 7. Fleſhly Delight, and Confidence in earthly Things, provokes God to hide his Face: When a Man ſmiles
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103263:32"/> ſo much on the World, and gives it ſo much room in his Heart, God frowns, and is offended, that the <hi>Gift</hi> ſhould be ſo much loved, and the <hi>Giver</hi> ſo neglected and forgotten.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When their Hearts are let out too little after God, and there grows a <hi>ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> between God and them, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to grow cold, dull and dead in Duty, then God withdraws and hides himſelf, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3, 5, 6. compared. But no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction like this, this diſquieteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the People of God indeed. And as all the Candles in the World cannot make it Day when the Sun is ſet; ſo all the Comforts in the World cannot rejoice ſuch a Soul, nor can there be any <hi>Day</hi> in ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h a Soul, until <hi>the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe there with healing in his Wings,</hi> Mal. 4. 2.</p>
            <p>So much for this Third Particular, ſhewing what this Heart-Trouble is, which our Lord here ſorbids his Diſciples, namely, Wordly-Sorrow, ſinful ſlaviſh Fear, diſtracting Care, Deſpondency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedneſs of Spirit, Diſtruſt, Offence at Perſecution for Chriſt's ſake, Satan's Temptations and Spiritual Deſertions, all which may either be the Cauſes, or the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103263:32"/> parts and pieces of Heart-Trouble, which muſt be avoided.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Particular to be opened, is to ſhew how that <hi>believing</hi> in God, and in Chriſt, is the beſt Antidote againſt this ſinful Heart-Trouble: Chriſt propoſeth it as a ſpecial Remedy.</p>

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:103263:67"/> earthly Comforts leave us, Sorrow fills our Hearts) but to cure this, our Lord anſwers them, that it was <hi>expedient for them,</hi> (good and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for them) that he ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, ſhewing them his End in going away, <hi>to wit,</hi> that he might ſend them the Comforter; he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from them a great <hi>Mercy,</hi> the greateſt earthly Mercy that ever they enjoyed, which was his <hi>perſonal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> they muſt part with ſo <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>near,</hi> ſo <hi>ſweet,</hi> ſo <hi>loving,</hi> ſo faithful a Friend as himſelf was to them: And could there be a greater loſs? for this <hi>Sorrow had filled their Hearts?</hi> But he tells them, it was to make way for a greater Mercy, which was, to ſend them the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter,</hi> in all the ſaving and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, by which they ſhould be able to <hi>do grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Works than he himſelf did,</hi> John 14. 12. which was a greater Mercy than his <hi>bodily</hi> Preſence with them, and with this he calms and quiets their Minds. Now, if we can act Faith upon the Bleſſed <hi>Ends</hi> of Chriſt, in removing our earthly Comforts
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103263:68"/> from us, which are, to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us <hi>better</hi> Mercies, to give us more of his Spirit, and of the Grace and Comforts of it, our Hearts would not be troubled; could we believe, that Chriſt's End in all his Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is, to prepare us for that Place in his Father's Houſe, it would comfort and ſupport us. His Ends are very good, and that ſhould quiet us. So long as the People of Chriſt enjoy moſt of the Comforts of this World, (I ſpeak it by ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) commonly they enjoy leaſt of God, and of his Spirit; and uſually when Chriſt takes away their earthly Comforts, then he manifeſts moſt of Himſelf, and of his tender Love to them: He brings them into the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> and then <hi>ſpeaks comfortably to them,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 14. then he ſpeaks to their Hearts, and not to their Ears only, as in time of Proſperity, then he gives out moſt of the Graces and Comforts of his Spirit. Chriſt never takes away theſe outward Mercies from his People, but with <hi>deſign</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow better, if our Diſcontent and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief do not hinder. When the Lord
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103263:68"/> took away from his Servant <hi>David</hi> the young Child begotten in Adultery, it was to give him a <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to ſhew what it is alſo to believe in Chriſt, that thereby we may prevent and cure our Heart-trouble.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing I have to do is, to ſhew how Faith acted thus on God and Chriſt, or, on God in Chriſt, is the beſt Preventive of, and <hi>Remedy</hi> to cure all our Heart-troubles, which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been ſhewn, partly in the two former Particulars, and will ſerve for the confirmation of the Point alſo.</p>
               <p>Two ways principally Faith acted on God and Chriſt, doth effect this great Cure of Heart-trouble, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>Hearts-Eaſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, By <hi>Applying</hi> and <hi>Apropriating</hi> God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chriſt to the Soul, and <hi>All</hi>

                  <hi>Diffidence</hi> is the cauſe of all <hi>Diſquiet;</hi> no true Reſt can be had, nor Quiet to our Minds, but by Confidence in God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. laſt. O the bleſſedneſs of thoſe that truſt in Chriſt. God in Chriſt is the only fit Object of our Confidence in all our Extremities. A Believer hath a God to go to in all his Troubles, an All-mighty and loving Father in Chriſt; and this ſhould be our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that we are in Covenant with him that rules the World, and hath committed the Government of all things to his Son, our dear Redeemer, who hath bought us with his Blood; and we may be ſure that no hurt ſhall befal us that he can hinder; and what cannot he hinder, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, and that hath the Keys of Hell and Death, unto whom we are ſo near, that he carries our Names on his Heart, and who will in his due time make all the World know, that his People are as dear to him as the Apple of his Eye.</p>
               <p>Truſt then, depend and rely upon God in Chriſt, and by an holy Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, reſign up your Wills to his Will, to do what he would have us
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103263:71"/> do; to be, what he would have us be; to ſuffer, what he would have us ſuffer; and then Heart-trouble will ceaſe, and ſweet Peace cometh: when having truſted all with God, we can in heart ſay, Lord, if thou wilt have me poor, diſgraced, impriſoned, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, deprived of my deareſt Friends; I am content to be ſo, I truſt all my Concerns with Thee: O the ſweet peace and quiet that will be in that Soul.</p>
               <p>There is the <hi>Almightineſs,</hi> the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs, Love, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of God in Chriſt for us to truſt in, and to rely upon, a <hi>Bottom</hi> and Foundation ſtrong enough to build our Confidence upon, in all Storms and Streights: God hath alſo made many <hi>exceeding great and precious Promiſes</hi> in his Word, and not a <hi>naked Promiſe,</hi> but he hath entred into Covenant with us, founded upon full ſatisfaction by the Blood of Jeſus, <hi>and confirmed it with an Oath,</hi> Heb. 6. 17. and to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſealed by the Blood of his Son, he hath added the Seals of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and all this, that the <hi>Heirs of the Promiſes,</hi> namely, All true Believers,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103263:71"/> 
                  <hi>night have ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> and be cured of all their Heart-troubles.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſure Foundation then muſt our Faith act in an holy Confidence in God, and in Chriſt: the Soul being taken off from all other Objects, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of Self, unto God and Chriſt; who preſently (as ſoon as truſted in) communicate themſelves, and their love, and goodneſs to the Soul, filling it with peace, ſtrength, and ſettlement. By this truſting in God, we honour God moſt, and beſt provide for our own ſafety.</p>
               <p>The way then, whereby Faith quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Soul, and cures it of its Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is, by <hi>raiſing</hi> it above all Diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>pitching</hi> it ſolely upon God in Chriſt; and thereby <hi>uniting</hi> it to God in Chriſt; from whence it draws Vertue and Strength, to ſubdue what ever troubleth its Peace. For the Soul is made for God, and never finds Reſt, till it return unto, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and center it ſelf upon him again. And that we may thus place our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God and Chriſt for all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, we muſt moſt earneſtly beg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cry, and ſeek to God for Grace and Strength

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If Faith acted upon God in Chriſt be ſuch a Remedy againſt Heart-trouble; then ſurely, Faith is a very precious, a very excellent thing; a Grace of very great worth and value, and of great uſe and efficacy: It is <hi>precious Faith</hi> indeed, the very <hi>Trial of it is more precious than Gold,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 7. Precious for its <hi>Author,</hi> the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; for its <hi>Object,</hi> precious Jeſus, and all the exceeding great and precious Promiſes, the purchaſed Inheritance: For its <hi>Offices,</hi> it unites to us Chriſt, gives us Title to eternal Life; it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports under all Afflictions; prevents, or cures all Heart-troubles; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103263:72"/> for its <hi>End,</hi> which is the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Souls, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 39. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>This Grace of Faith is of a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, ſpiritual Nature; and the Soul of a Believer, by acting it on God and Chriſt, and on Divine, Heavenly and Spiritual things, becomes Divine, Heavenly and Spiritual. Faith unfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Heart from the Creature, ſhewing the Soul the Vanity of it, and carries the Soul unto God and Chriſt, ſhewing it God's All-ſufficiency, and Chriſt's All-fulneſs; for Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, what God in his Word hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed of both. It is the great Deſign of God, in all the Troubles he ſends upon his People, effectually to teach them the exceeding Vanity of the Creature, to imbitter the things of this World to them, to wean their Hearts from them, to bring earthly things out of Requeſt with them, to make them ſee, that there is no true Contentment, nor ſolid Satisfaction for the Soul to be found in them, and to make them ſee where true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Contentment is to be had; even in God and in Chriſt alone,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103263:73"/> for whom their Souls were Created, Redeemed, and Sanctified. Now the great Work of Faith is, to take off the Soul from the Creature, and fix and ſettle it upon God and Chriſt the true Foundation. Naturally our Hearts hang looſe from God, and cleave to the Creature, and when the Creature fails, our Hearts are troubled; but Faith takes off the Heart from the Creature, and ſettles it upon God in Chriſt, where it finds Reſt; and this is the great Service it doth us. All the great and famous things which thoſe Worthies did, and all the hard and heavy things they ſuffered, mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. were all done and ſuffered by the Power of Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſetling of our Hearts upon God in Chriſt; truſting all there, is the beſt means to cure our Heart-trouble; and this Faith doth, and therefore it is precious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> It follows from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, That the want of Faith in God, and in Chriſt, is the Great Cauſe of all our Heart-Troubles, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies and Diſquietneſs. Could
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103263:73"/> we but act our Faith ſtrongly on God and Chriſt, as our God in Chriſt, our Troubles would be prevented or cured: For by Faith the Soul looks up to God in Chriſt, through the Promiſes, looking off from all other Supports, unto God for all Supplies, for the removing of all Evil felt or feared, and for the obtaining of all Good promiſed and needed; and by this exerciſe of Faith, the Soul is raiſed up above all Diſcouragements and Diſquietments: but where this Faith is wanting, or the lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it ſuſpended, there the Soul ſinks under Heart-Troubles. But of this ſome-what was ſaid before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Hence alſo we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee the abſolute Neceſſity of getting Faith in God, and in Chriſt; and of acting it, and living by it: There is no living quietly and comfortably without it, no ſtanding under our Burdens, no bearing with Patience and Chearfulneſs our Loſſes and Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes without this Faith; no Joy and Peace, but by believing; by Faith we ſtand.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:103263:74"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Then the Things of the World are not to be truſted to, nor truſted in, for Comfort in time of Trouble. Nothing but God and Chriſt to be truſted in, and truſted to, and there is enough in them to ſupport and comfort us, as hath been ſhewed: but no confidence to be put in the Creature; there is a Curſe upon ſuch Confidence, but a Bleſſing on them that truſt in God: No truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Friends, Riches, Gifts, or any thing; for ſo to do, is <hi>Idolatry,</hi> to give that to the Creature, which is due to God alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly.</hi> Hence we ſee the Reaſon why ſo many faint in the Day of Adverſity, and ſink under Trouble; and others uſe unlawful means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Trouble, or to get out of it: It is, becauſe they want this Faith in God and Chriſt; and for want of it, too many miſcarry under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p>The Second Uſe is, by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all the Diſciples of Chriſt,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103263:74"/> in the Words of the Text; <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled, but Believe in God, and Believe in Chriſt:</hi> You muſt get and act Faith in God and Chriſt, this is the only <hi>Preventive,</hi> the only <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt Heart-Trouble. Our Lord in this Text commands it, and commends it: we muſt <hi>needs</hi> get Faith above all gettings; next to Chriſt, we muſt get Faith, for we cannot have Chriſt without Faith: Go to God for it, it is his <hi>Work,</hi> his <hi>Gift,</hi> yea, it is his <hi>Operation;</hi> yea, the ſame <hi>Power</hi> that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead, muſt be put forth upon a Soul to work Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20. The exceeding great and mighty work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Power of God, to raiſe up the Soul to God and Chriſt, and to enable it to lay hold on God and Chriſt: for ſuch is our natural proneneſs to live by Senſe and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon; and ſuch is the moſt tranſcendent Excellency of God and Chriſt, and of Divine Things, which Faith looks unto; and ſo great an Inclination we have to <hi>Self-ſufficiency,</hi> and ſo much rooted in <hi>Self-Love,</hi> and inordinate Love of the Creature, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103263:75"/> ſo hard to take off the Soul from falſe bottoms; and becauſe we are ſuch <hi>Strangers</hi> to God naturally; and becauſe there is ſo much Guilt of Sin ſtill remaining on us, by our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Provocations, that we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to entertain ſerious Thoughts of God: and becauſe of that infinite <hi>Diſtance</hi> between God and us, we can never come to believe in him, and rely upon him, until our Hearts be renewed by the Power of Grace, and this Divine Grace of Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into them: Therefore muſt we go to God and Chriſt, and put up ſtrong Cries and Prayers to God to work Faith in us, and never give over, until it be wrought in us.</p>
               <p>And having got Faith, we muſt act and exerciſe it upon God in Chriſt; upon God, I ſay, He only is the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith, and is worthy of it; for a Man can be in no condition, in which God is at a loſs, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help him: If Comforts and means of Deliverance be wanting, God can <hi>create</hi> Comforts, and <hi>command</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 19. He can bring Light out of Darkneſs, to him all things are poſſible.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:103263:75"/>
               <p n="1"> 1. Then, Faith aſſents to, and is perſwaded that there is a God, the Infinite <hi>Firſt,</hi> and <hi>Beſt Being</hi> of all things, and who giveth Being to all Things, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That in this Bleſſed Being are Three Perſons, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and all the Object of our Faith.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Faith is acted by Meditating on, Conſidering of, and Applying, and Appropriating of God in Chriſt to the Soul, laying claim to all that God is, and to all that God hath as its own.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, That our Hearts may not be troubled, but fully ſatisfied and comforted, we muſt by Faith lay <hi>hold on</hi> God, take hold of God's Strength, which is his Mercy in Chriſt; and moſt ſolemnly, moſt conſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and moſt ſincerely take God for our God in Chriſt, and <hi>actually</hi> enter into Covenant with him: This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is founded upon Jeſus Chriſt, his Satisfaction and Righteouſneſs; and therefore we muſt alſo believe in Chriſt, taking him for our only

                  <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> receiving him by Faith as he is offered to us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to be All in All to us.</p>
               <p>As God offers, ſo Faith receives; God offers himſelf in Chriſt, and ſo Faith receives him. God doth, as it were, ſay in the Goſpel, O poor loſt Sinner, come to my Son Jeſus, take him for thy only Lord and Saviour; and by him come to me, and take me for thy God and Father: and by Faith the poor Believer ecchoeth back, My Lord and my God, I humbly and heartily come to thee, accept of thee, cloſe with thee: and ſo by Faith the believing Soul becomes one with God and Chriſt; and hereupon the Soul by Faith cleaves to God and Chriſt, and unfeignedly, and unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, reſigns and gives up its whole ſelf to God in Chriſt, taking God in Chriſt for his, and intirely ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders up it ſelf to be the Lord's. <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his.</hi> Now Faith thus acted, will certainly cure all our Heart-Troubles.</p>

Have we unfeignedly given up our ſelves to Chriſt? Have we actually entred into Covenant with him, and taken him for our Head and Husband? Have we paſſed over and ſurrendred up our whole ſelves to Chriſt, our Souls, Bodies, all our Concerns? Have we given up our Hearts, Heads, Tongues, Time, Talents, Eſtates, Libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Again, if we truly <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, then he is <hi>ours,</hi> for it is by Faith that we receive him, and are united to him, and made one with him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. and are by his Spirit and Word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and made new Creatures, and are enabled to walk after the Spirit, and not after the Fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1, 2. <hi>He that believeth, hath the Witneſs in himſelf,</hi> 1 John 5. 10. he need not go far to ſeek: Make ſure thy believing in Chriſt, and thou haſt the Witneſs in thy <hi>ſelf</hi> that he is <hi>thine,</hi> and that thou art <hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But how ſhall we know that we have true Faith, and that we do truly believe in Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Briefly, thus: If we have been
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103263:82"/> made ſenſible of our loſt Condition by Nature, of our miſery by Sin, of our Unbelief; if we have found it an hard Work to believe; if we have been made weary and heavy-laden with Sin, ſo as to be truly willing to part with all Sin; if we have been convinced of our abſolute need of Chriſt, and of his incomparable <hi>Excellency,</hi> of his <hi>All-ſufficiency,</hi> and <hi>willingneſs</hi> to ſave us; if Chriſt be moſt precious to us; if theſe Convictions have been powerful in us, to drive us from our Selves, and the Creature, and Sin; if we have hereupon been perſwaded and enabled ſincerely to come unto Chriſt upon his Call in the Goſpel, to accept of him upon his Terms, and to receive him, as he is offered to us in the Goſpel; if our whole Hearts have opened to him, and cloſed with him, and we have given up our whole ſelves entirely to him, and taken him for our only Lord and Saviour, as the only way to God, and do moſt ſincerely reſign up our ſelves to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, truſting in him alone, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon him for Life and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for Grace and Glory; then we
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103263:82"/> do believe in him, then have we this true Faith: which is further to be known thus, that it worketh in us true ſincere Love to him, and to all that is his, his Word, his People; your Hearts will run out after him, all your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will center in him. This true Faith draws Vertue from Chriſt to purify the Heart, and works Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Holineſs; it doth crucify your Affections to the World, it works true Repentance, and enables you to overcome the World, and to realize the Glory of Heaven, and to bear us up under all the Troubles in our way thither, as in that <hi>11th</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> enabling us to truſt and betruſt our ſelves, our Souls and Bodies, and all our Concernments with Chriſt; by this Faith we ſhall <hi>ſtand,</hi> by it we <hi>walk,</hi> by it we <hi>live,</hi> and hold on, and hold out in following the <hi>Lamb</hi> to the end of of our Life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now certainly he that thus believes in Chriſt, hath no cauſe of Heart-trouble, but quietly ſubmits to the good Will of his God in Chriſt, under all the Diſpenſations of his Providence, while he is here in this Vale of Tears,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103263:83"/> until he come home to his Father's Houſe in Peace, where he ſhall meet his deareſt Lord, and an hearty wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. O this Faith, this precious Faith in Chriſt will conquer all our baſe Fears, moderate all our worldly Sorrows, eaſe our Minds perplexed with earthly Cares, and quiet our diſturbed and diſtracted Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our outward Loſſes and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: By this <hi>Faith</hi> we ſhall find all our Loſſes made up in God and in Chriſt. O then labour for it, cry mightily to God for this great Gift; cry to Jeſus for it, he is the Author and Finiſher of it; and labour to act it upon him continually, and your Hearts ſhall not be troubled.</p>
               <p>I dare affirm, That if any thing bring <hi>Hearts-Eaſe</hi> in Heart-Trouble, this will do it. So long as our Faith holds up in Act and Exerciſe upon Chriſt, we ſhall be free from Heart-trouble; but when our Faith fails, our Heart troubles prevail: As when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> lifted up his Hands, (and his Heart too by Faith) <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed; but when his Hands were down, <hi>Amalek</hi> prevailed. Faith and Heart-trouble
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103263:83"/> are like a pair of Ballances, when one goes up, the other goes down: Faith is the Counter-poize of Trouble of Heart. Believe then in Jeſus, act Faith on him, and that will prevent or cure Heart-trouble. Continue in the Faith, and your Heart-troubles will ceaſe; believe what Chriſt is, and what he is to us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let us believe in Chriſt, and believe <hi>where he is.</hi> As to his <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential</hi> Preſence, he is in Heaven, at the Father's right Hand, <hi>making conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual interceſſion for us</hi> to the Father, Heb. 12. 2, 3. Heb. 7. 25. <hi>He is our Advocate with the Father,</hi> 1 John 2. 1, 2. pleading our Cauſe, preſenting all our Services, perfumed with his own Righteouſneſs, and reſenting and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our Infirmities, Sorrows and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſympathiſing with us; <hi>In all our Afflictions he is afflicted,</hi> Iſa. 63. 9. He knows all our Troubles, Trials, Temptations, Sickneſſes, Loſſes and Miſeries. Jeſus himſelf knew, when he was on Earth, what it was to loſe a Friend; He wept when his Friend <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead. He is a moſt tender-hearted Saviour, a moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103263:84"/> High Prieſt: He ſees and feels now in Heaven all the Miſeries of his People upon Earth, and pleads for them there; believe this, and let not your Hearts be troubled.</p>
               <p>And as to his Spiritual and Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Preſence, he is always with his People on Earth: He is <hi>in</hi> his People, <hi>Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory,</hi> Col. 1. 27. He is in his Word and Ordinances by his Spirit, to bleſs them to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Chriſt is All,</hi> Col. 3. 11. <hi>and in All.</hi> He is <hi>All,</hi> that is, inſtead of <hi>All,</hi> of Father, Mother, Husband, Wife; of Son and Daughter; inſtead of Health, Wealth, Liberty, and All to his People; <hi>In him dwelleth all Fulneſs,</hi> Eph. 1. 23. and 3. 17. And he is alſo <hi>in</hi> All, <hi>he filleth all in all.</hi> In all his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>he dwells in their Hearts by Faith.</hi> All our freſh Springs are in him: All the Strength, Support, and Comfort we have, comes from him: He is in all Providences, be they never ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo afflictive, never ſo ſmarting, ſo deſtructive to our Earthly Comforts, Chriſt is in them all; his Love, his Wiſdom, his Mercy, his Pity and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is in them all, every Cup is of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103263:84"/> his preparing; it is Jeſus your beſt Friend, (O ye poor Believers) who moſt dearly loves you; It is he that died for you, that appoints all thoſe Providences, orders them all, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules, moderates and ſanctifies them all, and will ſweeten them all; and in his due time will make them All profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto you, that you ſhall have cauſe one day to praiſe and bleſs his Name for them all. O that we could but believe all this, and could by Faith look unto our Jeſus in all dark Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and by Faith behold this Jeſus managing of them, and believe his Love, Wiſdom, Tenderneſs and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in all; in our Sickneſſes, Loſſes, Priſons, Reſtraints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then ſurely our Hearts ſhould not be troubled.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Believe in Chriſt, Believe what he hath told us; <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions; if it were not ſo, I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> John 14. 3. Let us act Faith upon theſe true ſweet ſayings of our dear Lord, who is Truth it ſelf; <hi>In my Father's Houſe are many Manſions.</hi> In <hi>my</hi> Father's Houſe; <hi>my</hi> Father's, and <hi>your</hi> Father's Houſe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103263:85"/> one Houſe muſt hold us all. <hi>John</hi> 20. 17. <hi>I aſcend to my Father, and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to my God, and your God;</hi> and it is in that Houſe which is <hi>far above all Heavens,</hi> all viſible Elementary Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, <hi>the third Heaven;</hi> that is, the Father's Houſe, <hi>That Houſe not made with hands, whoſe builder and maker is God,</hi> and <hi>is Eternal,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2. This <hi>City of the living God,</hi> this <hi>New Jeruſalem;</hi> there, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Manſions,</hi> many Dwellings, many fixed, abiding, laſting, everlaſting Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations: Not Tents and Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſuch as we live in here on Earth, but <hi>Manſions,</hi> abiding-places. Is not this a moſt comfortable Conſideration to ſuch poor Saints, as have here on Earth no certain dwelling-places, not an Houſe of their own wherein to lay their Heads, but are forc'd to remove from place to place, ſtill ſeeking an Habitation, baniſhed from Family and Friends, from Relations and Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſome caſt into Priſons, (while others dwell ſafely in their own Houſes, and none to make them afraid,) and others expoſed to much hardſhip and danger; I ſay, this is good news to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103263:85"/> them, That in their Father's Houſe are many Manſions; there are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Habitations ready to receive them, made ready for them; from which, when once they are entred, they ſhall never be caſt out more: from whence there ſhall be no more any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move for ever. When once their earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle is broken down, they ſhall poſſeſs that <hi>Houſe, not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi> Let us then by Faith often look into the Father's Houſe, and view, and review thoſe many Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are there; and let us act Hope alſo, that ſhortly we ſhall poſſeſs that Place, and enjoy that bleſſed State: The believing frequent Proſpects of that place, will prevent our Heart-trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or cure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it were not ſo, I would have told you,</hi> ſaith our Lord: If there were not ſuch a bleſſed State, and glorious Place for you my Diſciples in the other World, after all your Sufferings in this, I would have told you ſo: For I have told of the many Troubles you muſt endure in this World; and for your ſupport and comfort, I am now

               <p>
                  <hi>I go to prepare a Place for you.</hi> I have <hi>purchaſed</hi> this moſt glorious Place for you, by my Blood; I have <hi>promiſed</hi> it to you; now I go away to take <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion</hi> of it for you, in your Name and Stead: O what an Heart-comforting, and Heart-eaſing Conſideration ſhould this be to us poor Believers, That our Lord went from Earth to Heaven, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Heaven and heavenly Glory is ſaid to be <hi>prepared: A Kingdom prepared from the Foundation of the World,</hi> Matth. 25. 34. If we could believe, that Chriſt hath prepared a Place in Heaven for us, and that Heaven will make amends for all our Sufferings in the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and if we could keep the Eye of our Faith upon that <hi>Recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that far more exceeding and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 16, 17, 18. we ſhould bear up bravely under all our Sufferings, and not have our Hearts troubled.</p>
               <p>Let us then look more Heaven-ward, more to our Father's Houſe; Let us have our Converſations more in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>ſet our Affections more upon</hi>

            <p>Secondly; Some things are <hi>Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant.</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We muſt read and hear it <hi>as the Word of God, and not as the Word of Man,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 13. Acts 10. 33. and we muſt acknowledg God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in it.</p>

            <p n="6">(6.) Prayer muſt be added again for a Bleſſing.</p>

I am perſwaded, this is one great Reaſon why moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſo little by the Word, becauſe they make no Conſcience of Meditation; they hear and read, but never think more on it afterwards: So Preaching, Hearing, Reading, and all loſt; and Souls, and Heaven, and all loſt.

               <hi>Direct.</hi> III. Thirdly; Would we have Faith? Let us engage our whole Souls in the deep and ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the infinite, unſpeakable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Love of God the Father in this, the higheſt and fulleſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it, in giving his Son, his only begotten Son, to be a Sin-Offer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, a Sacrifice, a Ranſom for poor Sinners, and that for this very end and purpoſe, that we poor Sinners might believe in him, and by believing, might not periſh, but might have Eternal Life. I pray read and ponder upon the following Texts, and let your moſt ſerious Thoughts fix on them, and meditate on them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. throughout; <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8. 10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. &amp; 8. 32. with many other, which for brevity ſake I cannot tranſcribe. If we can but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this wonderful Love of God the Father, in giving his dear Son to be a <hi>Surety,</hi> a <hi>Sin-Offering, to lay all our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities on him;</hi> that <hi>he was pleaſed to bruiſe him, and put him to Grief</hi> for us; and conſider and meditate upon the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:103263:96"/> 
               <hi>Heighth and Depth, the Breadth and Length</hi> of this immenſe, imcompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Love of God, in giving his Son, and that on purpoſe, that we might believe in him, and by beleiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing might have Eternal Life; I ſay, it will greatly help us to believe in his Son, to accept of this his unſpeakable Gift, and to receive him as he is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Moreover, let us alſo conſider of, and deeply meditate upon the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Love of the Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who, though he were the <hi>Delight</hi> of his Father, and lay in the <hi>Boſom</hi> of his Father, even then his <hi>Delights</hi> were with the Sons of Men, then was his Heart full of Love to poor Sinners; and his Love brought him down from Heaven to Earth, to aſſume Humane Nature, to take upon him all the Sins of his People, to bear them on his Soul and Body in the Garden, there ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great drops of <hi>Blood,</hi> and on the Croſs, there pouring out his Heart-Blood, made a Curſe, endured the full meaſure of the Wrath of God due for Sin, and became the Ranſom of Souls, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44.

            <p>But while I am writing theſe things, I cannot but conceive an Indignation againſt my ſelf, and heartily wiſh, I were filled with Shame, Sorrow, and Grief of Spirit, that having read and heard ſo often of the ſurpaſſing Love of God the Father, in giving his Son; and ſo often of the unſpeakable Love of Jeſus, and to be no more affected with it, no more ſenſible of it; to have my Affections no more ſtirred and moved, no more quickned and warmed: Alas, my dead Heart, my Adamantine Heart! Lord, ſprinkle it with that Blood, Lord, ſhed abroad that Love of thine upon my Heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly by the holy Ghoſt; Lord Jeſus, manifeſt thy Love to me, that I may love thee. I am aſhamed and pained for want of Love to God, to Jeſus; O that I could believe thy Love to my Soul, then I ſhould not chuſe but love thee. Lord, I believe, help my Unbelief. The conſideration of this
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:103263:97"/> Love of God, and of Chriſt, is a means to work Faith; try it, I pray you, and you will find it ſo.</p>
